1.Create VP
  Go to VPC → Your VPCs → Create VPC
  Name: project-vpc
  IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16
  Create.
2.Create Public Subnet
  Go to Subnets → Create subnet
  VPC: project-vpc
  Subnet name: public-subnet-1
  CIDR block: 10.0.1.0/24
  After creation: enable Auto-assign public IPv4.
3.Create Private Subnet
  Create another subnet:
      Name: private-subnet-1
      CIDR: 10.0.2.0/24
  Do not auto-assign public IPs.
4.Create Internet Gateway
  Go to Internet Gateways → Create
  Name: project-igw
  Attach to project-vpc.
5.Create NAT Gateway (optional but recommended)
  Create an Elastic IP.
  Go to NAT Gateways → Create NAT gateway
  Subnet: public-subnet-1
  Elastic IP: the one you created.
  Create and wait until available.
6.Configure Route Tables
  Public route table:
      Go to Route tables → Create name public-rt.
      Associate with public-subnet-1.
      Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway (project-igw).
  Private route table:
      Create private-rt.
      Associate with private-subnet-1.
      Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway.
7.Launch Test EC2 Instances
  One in public-subnet-1 with public IP:
      Should be reachable from the internet (with correct SG).
  One in private-subnet-1:
      No public IP, but can reach internet via NAT for updates.
